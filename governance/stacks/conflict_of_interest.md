# Conflict of Interest

## Our Inspiration
Transparency is a core principal of Citizen Labs. The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect Citizen Labsâ€™ interest when it is contemplating a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the Citizen Labs.


## Method: Conflict of Interest

Whenever a director or officer has a financial or personal interest in any matter coming before the board of directors, the affected person shall a) fully disclose the nature of the interest and b) withdraw from discussion, lobbying, and voting on the matter. Any transaction or vote involving a potential conflict of interest shall be approved only when a majority of disinterested directors determine that it is in the best interest of the corporation to do so. The minutes of meetings at which such votes are taken shall record such disclosure, abstention and rationale for approval.
