### AGENDA

**Last Meeting Follow-up**

- Selection of officers: Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, Treasurer
 - At our September 6 Hack Night we were able to discuss as a group with Max Dillivan the Bylaws regarding officer selection. Max believes that it would be appropriate and within the Bylaws to elect our officers on January 10, 2017. General consensus supported the Jan 2017 election date.
- Review legal status [options for Citizen Labs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3qVFElM6gGRhtZcqiPVet2dbfJxzyOO-h_bNLkdImM/edit?usp=sharing)
